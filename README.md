# My clone of i3bar-river in waybar
River window manager is a very great with it's own dope features like custom layouts and blazingly fast zig as language of choice.

However, I had to go back to Hyprland because of some caveats with installing dwindle for NixOS, but the implementation of i3bar was stuck in my mind.

So, I made this clone/copy of i3bar-river with same visual look and added tray module.

Hope you like it!
